# InventoryNeeded Assignment

Java practice program to read and write to file:

	•The BMC Parts Company needs a program that will read the inventory.txt file and create an inventory report based on the data in the file.
	•The inventory.txt file contains the part number, opening balance, number of items sold, and the minimum stock required.
	•The output file, inventoryNeeded.txt, will contain the part number, current balance and the amount that is necessary to bring the inventory to the minimum level.
	•In this assignment, you will design the logic for the program that reads the input file and creates the output file.
	•Files provided include inventory.txt and the partially completed program inventoryNeeded.java.
	•The program file provided includes the necessary variable declarations and input and output file statements.
	•You need to write the part of the program that reads the input file, calculates the current balance and amount required to bring the inventory to the minimum level.
	•Then output the part number, current balance and the amount needed to the output file.
	•In this assignment, you can submit both the .java and the .class files for the completed program along with the output file created from the program execution.
